        > We present you a black-box.
        
        `pymoog` is a python3 wrapper for running the LTE spectrum synthesis part of the code [MOOG](https://www.as.utexas.edu/~chris/moog.html) by Chris Sneden.
        The synthetic spectra from optical to near infrared region of the model stars in Kurucz model ATLAS can be generated by `pymoog` in a few commands.
        This package can be run in Linux or Mac system.

        There is also [a stand-alone version](https://github.com/MingjieJian/moog_nosm) of the MOOG used in this package.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Install gfortran compilar
        
        [gfortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran) is a free Fortran compiler as a part of GCC.
        Although it is possible to use other Fortran compiler to compile MOOG, using gfortran is (to my experience) the mose easy one and thus pymoog requires gcc to be installed before pip install. 
        
        - Check whether gfortran is installed in your computer
        
        Type `gfortran` in the terminal; if you get:
        
        ```
        gfortran: fatal error: no input files
        compilation terminated.
        ```
        
        then gfortran is already installed and please go to [Install pymoog](#install-pymoog). 
        
        If you get:
        
        ```
        command not found: gfortran
        ```
        
        then you need to install gfortran.
        
        - Linux: `sudo apt install gcc`
        
        -  Windows: please use [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) and follow the instruction for Linux.
        
        - Mac: please refer to [this post](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8336714); the main point is using `brew` to install (`brew install gcc`).
        I have no experience on using Mac so I haven't test it. 
        
        ### <a name="install-pymoog"></a>Install pymog
        
        - Using pypi (recommended)
            - `pip install pymoog`
            - You can also check whether the latest version is installed in [here](https://pypi.org/project/pymoog/).
        - From github
            - `clone` this repository and `cd` into the corresponding folder;
            - `pip install .`
        
        ## Tutorial
        
        Once you are done with the installation, you can use the `pymoog` package now on your code!
        
        For tutorial, Please refer to [this notebook](docs/Tutorial.ipynb).
        Please download it and [solar_spec.txt](https://github.com/MingjieJian/pymoog/blob/master/docs/solar_spec.txt) in the same folder.
        
        Documentation is available in [here](https://pymoog.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
